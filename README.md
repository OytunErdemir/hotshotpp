Preprocessing.py: creates the input files for the CNN model of tensorflow, then trains the CNN and saves the weights of the model. Photos should be in a folder named "photos" in the main folder. Output.csv should also be present in the master folder.

predict.py: creates the same model structure in the preprocessing.py (it should be exactly the same) and loads the weights of the trained model from preprocessing stage.
